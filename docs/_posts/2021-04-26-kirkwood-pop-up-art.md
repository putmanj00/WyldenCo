This Saturday, I had the pleasure of attending the First Annual Pop Up Exhibit at the newly rennovated Performing Arts Center in Kirkwod, MO.

The event was hosted by [Gray Finch Studios](https://www.grayfinchstudios.com/), and coordinated by Timothy Wagner and Allie Grant. At around 25 artists, the Performing Arts Center opened it's doors to the public for the first of (what I hope to be) many art exhibits.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the ecnter was held on Thursday, November 8, 2018, and had a completion date of 2020, but due to the pandemic, plans changed. Clocking in at around 26 million, the center wasn't cheap, but with help from donations (and over $500,000 from the Kirkwood Theatre Guild), the project was completed as planned. As a new home for the [Kirkwood Theatre Guild](https://www.ktg-onstage.org/new-arts-center) and [STAGES](https://stagesstlouis.org/pac/), a Chesterfield broadway theatre group, the Performing Arts Center is just getting started.

From the moment you get out of your car, you can sense the creativity emminating from the building from it's sleek modern architecture. Once you walk through the main doors, you can see that the architects made sure that quality and asthetics were at the forefront of Kirkwoods shareholders minds. If the goal was to bring a piece of New York to Missouri, that goal was accomplished (I've never been to New York, but I imagine the beautiful interior of the Performing Arts Center is something you'd encunter whilst attending a broadway or art show in the Big Apple)

As I wandered around, talking to different artists, I was amazed at how well the lighting added to all of the artwork, helping illuminate and bring it to life, giving it the spotlight the artists deserve. 

As the title of the show suggests, this is the first Annual Pop Up Exhibit, so be on the lookout for next year's show! Based on the success of this exhibit, I have a feeling that this is just first of, what I hope to be, many events helping showcase amazing local artists and their hard work.
