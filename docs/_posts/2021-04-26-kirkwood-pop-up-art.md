The groundbreaking ceremony for the center was held on Thursday, November 8, 2018, and construction completed in 2020, however, due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the $26 million jewel of Kirkwood opened to limited events and minimal attendance.
As the new home for [STAGES](https://stagesstlouis.org/pac/), a Chesterfield Broadway Theater Group, and the [Kirkwood Theatre Guild](https://www.ktg-onstage.org/new-arts-center), whose $500,000 donation contributed to the center's development, the Performing Arts Center is only gearing up.

<h3>Arrival</h3>
From the moment I arrived at KPAC on the drizzly morning of April 24th, I could feel the creativity emminating from the building from it's sleek modern architecture comprised of an asymetrical placement of concrete, glass and steel. As I approached the building, the details of the building stood out more. The back half of the building housed the theatre, and is constructed of concrete. The front portion contained the exhibit, and resembled two shipping containers that had been stacked and offset. The exterior walls of the  were lined with vertical slats of metal various tints of grey, while the front of the building was brilliantly designed with tall windows to showcase the KPAC lobby.

The feeling of wonder at what lie ahead, coupled with the overwhelming sense of excitement at the opportunity to gourge my senses with new art, was like greeting an old friend after spending years apart. Once I walked through the main doors, I could see that the architects made sure that quality and asthetics were at the forefront of Kirkwoods shareholders minds. If the goal was to bring a piece of New York to Missouri, that goal was accomplished (I've never been to New York, but I imagine the beautiful interior of the Performing Arts Center is something you'd encunter whilst attending a broadway or art show in the Big Apple).

<h3>Meeting the Artists</h3>
As I wandered around, talking to different artists, I was amazed at how well the lighting added to all of the artwork, helping illuminate and bring it all to life. The balance between carefully placed artificial lighting, and sunlight that entered through the towering windows, provided the perfect amount of light to allow the artists, and visitors, a way to truly appreciate the art as the artists intended.

The first artist I had the pleasure of meeting was [Nela Navarrine](https://www.nelanavarrine.com). Not only is she talented with oil paint on canvas, but uses oils and waxes in between layers of polyurethane resin, creating a breathtaking amount of life, depth and realism that is only amplified in the natural light.

The next artist I visited, was [Gray Finch](https://www.grayfinchstudios.com/). Gray's art is layered as well, but also in a metaphorical sense. A pleasing mashup of images of the animal kingdom and nature, an exploration of western philosophy, and various mediums of art, Gray is able to bring the visitor into his journey of exploration. As a trained painter, Gray uses the techniques he learned to add pops of color, texture and depth to his works. In a way, his art almost tell storys. Each piece, a different chapter in his story of evolution as an artist.



<h3>Takeaway</h3>
As the title of the show suggests, this is the first Annual Pop Up Exhibit, so be on the lookout for next year's show! Based on the success of this exhibit, I have a feeling that this is just first of, what I hope to be, many events helping showcase amazing local artists and their hard work.
