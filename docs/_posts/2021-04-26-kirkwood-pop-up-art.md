Attending the first Semi-Annual Pop Up Exhibit at the newly rennovated Kirkwood Performing Arts Center, or KPAC, in Kirkwod, MO.

<h3>KPAC</h3>

The event was hosted by [Gray Finch Studios](https://www.grayfinchstudios.com/), and coordinated by Timothy Wagner and Allie Grant. At 25 artists, the Performing Arts Center opened it's doors to the public for the first of many performing and visual arts exhibitions. 

The groundbreaking ceremony for the center was held on Thursday, November 8, 2018, and construction completed in 2020, however, due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the $26 million jewel of Kirkwood opened to limited events and minimal attendance.
As the new home for [STAGES](https://stagesstlouis.org/pac/), a Chesterfield Broadway Theater Group, and the [Kirkwood Theatre Guild](https://www.ktg-onstage.org/new-arts-center), whose $500,000 donation contributed to the center's development, the Performing Arts Center is only gearing up.

From the moment I arrived at KPAC on the drizzly morning of April 24th, I could feel the creativity emminating from the building from its sleek modern architecture comprised of an asymetrical placement of concrete, glass and steel. As I approached the center, the details began to emerge. The back half of the building holds the theatre, and is constructed of concrete. The front portion hosted the exhibit and resembled two shipping containers that had been stacked and offset. Monochromatic greys colored vertical slats of metal that created the exterior of the shipping container portions of KPAC, while the front of the building was brilliantly designed with tall windows to showcase the KPAC lobby. All of this created a marvelous display of Brutalist architecture. 

The feeling of wonder at what lie ahead, coupled with the overwhelming sense of excitement at the opportunity to gourge my senses with new art, was like greeting an old friend after spending years apart. Once I walked through the main doors, I could see that the architects made sure that quality and asthetics were at the forefront of Kirkwoods shareholders minds. If the goal were to bring a piece of New York to Missouri, that goal was accomplished (I have never been to New York, but I imagine the beautiful interior of the Performing Arts Center is something you would encunter whilst attending a broadway or art show in the Big Apple).

Being a people person, I tried to make an effort to chat with each artist, but only had enough time to make it to a few booths that lined the walls of the KPAC. I was amazed at how well the lighting added to all the artwork, helping illuminate and bring it all to life. The balance between carefully placed artificial lighting, and sunlight that entered through the towering windows, provided the perfect amount of light to allow the artists, and visitors, a way to truly appreciate the art as the artists intended.

<h2>Nela Navarrine</h2>
The first artist I had the pleasure of meeting was [Nela Navarrine](https://www.nelanavarrine.com). Her booth was the first one as I entered the exhibit. Not only is she talented with oil paint on canvas, but uses oils and waxes in between layers of polyurethane resin, creating a breathtaking amount of life, depth and realism that is only amplified in the natural light. The combination of oil pantings and resin art of flowers and nature made her booth feel like a garden of creativity.

<h2>Gray Finch</h2>
The next artist I visited, was [Gray Finch](https://www.grayfinchstudios.com/). He was right next door to Nela's booth. Gray's art is layered as well, but also in a metaphorical sense. A pleasing mashup of images of the animal kingdom and nature, an exploration of western philosophy, and various mediums of art, Gray can bring the visitor into his journey of exploration. As a trained painter, Gray uses the techniques he learned to add pops of color, texture and depth to his works. In a way, his art almost tells storys. Each piece, a different chapter in his story of evolution as an artist. Gray was accompanied by his two helpful sons and his supportive wife. I could tell his sons enjoyed hepling their father, as they showcased Gray's work as I spoke to him about his process.

<h2>Goz Goose</h2>
As I moved on from hanging out with Gray and his family, I visited his neighbor, the booth of [Goz Goose](https://www.facebook.com/artbygoz). While I did not get a chance to talk with Goz much, as he was chatting with other folks, I did get an opportunigy to read about his story and view his art. Goz modified a recommendation from his VA psychiatrist to journal about his feelings, and instead, took all that mental static, and brought it to life with canvas and paint. Detailed and thought provoking are two ways I would describe Goz's work. Goz's mission of using his past and his craft to bring about awareness surrounding mental health, and societies stigma towards it, is as admirable as it is comforting.

<h2>Be Cosmic Creations</h2>
After I was done, I moved upstairs and dropped by the booth of [Be Cosmic Creations](https://www.instagram.com/becosmiccreations/). On display were a dazziling array of hand crafted acrylic pours. The duos unique selection of canvas for some of their pours is what initially caught my attention. Some pieces were stand alone, and others were part of a series, but each piece was like looking into an alternate psychacelic universe. By adding UV reactive and glow in the dark acrylic, Be Cosmic Creations' pours are also able to be enjoyed under a blacklight or in the dark!

<h2>Paz Happy Creations</h2>
My next stop took me to [Erin Pazderka](https://www.etsy.com/shop/pazhappycreations/). Her work with glass, handcrafted jewlry and original artwork was a nice change of scenery from the booths downstairs. Erin's original artwork utilizes photos and places phrases on them, resurrecting old snapshots of time and breathing new life and meaning into them. Of all the booths I stopped by, hers had the most variety, showcasing her many talents, ranging from original art, paint on canvas, jewlry and even pieces of electroformed art!

<h2>Natham Adam</h2>
The highlight of my journey was visiting the booth of [Nathan Adam](https://www.instagram.com/naytan_atom/). A hidden gem among the artists, Nathan was the only artist I saw that was not only creating live art, but also allowing others to participate and crate their own art! Helping Nathan out, was his girlfriend Juanita Ziegler, who helped answer questions, engage the audience and help bring the energy to an already electrifying art booth! Trained in various art forms, Nathan's most recent work revolves around screenprinting using emulsion. It was hard to miss seeing Nathan's works around the gallery, as some folks put on their shirts once they were dry and were proudly showing the world the art they created with the guiding hand of Nathan. Nathan was also the only artist I saw that was going soley off of donations, allowing the public to walk away with unique art at no cost.

<h2>Mugs of Mud</h2>
After visiting Nathan, I noticed that the show would be ending soon, so I wrapped up my business upstairs and stopped by a booth I saw earlier that was displaying pottery. [Mugs of Mud](https://www.instagram.com/mugsofmud/) had a nice and calming booth setup. As the name suggests, Mugs of Mud makes mugs from thrown clay! As a coffee connoisseur, and lover of ceramics, I had to pay a visit before the show ended. This booth was the only booth that I had the pleasure of visiting, that dontated a portion of proceeds to a good cause. Mugs of Mud donates 10% to the [Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/), from all rainbow mug sales, so I was sure to snag a rainbow mug!

<h3>Takeaway</h3>
As the title of the show suggests, this is the first Semi-Annual Pop-Up Exhibit, so be on the lookout for the next show! Based on the success of this exhibit, I have a feeling that this is just first of, what I hope to be, many events helping showcase amazing local artists and their hard work.

Although the weather could have been better, and my late arrival prevented me from visiting all the artists, the show was just what I, and the artists, needed: an opportunity to be around creativity. With the events of last year and the world’s reaction to it, we must not forget the healing power that art can bring. Being able to express our feelings through various mediums and allowing others to share that experience with us is something that is part of what makes us human. More than ever, we need more art.
