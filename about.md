WyldenCo. was created with a few ideas in mind:

- As a way to help promote local artists, musicians and businesses and bring back the sense of community by helping each other out. 

- A place to present information and knowledge that has been gathered from various topics over the years.

- Promote and explore various sustainable agricultural practices for cultivating cannabis and other plants.
